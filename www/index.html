<h1>DrNokSnes</h1>
<p><strong>DrNokSnes</strong> is a Super Nintendo Entertainment
System Emulator for the Nokia N800 and N810 Internet Tablets, and
the N900 mobile phone.</p>
<p>It is a port (with some modifications plus a new interface) of
<a href="http://reesy.gp32x.de/DrPocketSnes.html">DrPocketSnes</a>,
which is a mix of both PocketSnes and SquidgeSnes, originally
designed with the GP32/GP2X in mind. Many thanks to Reesy and all
the original authors for making a very fast emulator.</p>
<p>Please use <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras">extras
repository</a> to install. Currently it's only in extras-devel.</p>

<h2>Manual</h2>
<p>To be written. For now, remember the launcher has a menu.</p>
<p>The package installs a command line version of the emulator
(<em>drnoksnes</em>), so if you want to try options not still on
GUI, try <tt>drnoksnes --help</tt>. The command line version also
allows you to create a bit more advanced key mappings.</p>
<p>The emulator will load a configuration file from
<em>~/.config/drnoksnes.txt</em>. This file is a popt-based
configuration file, which means it uses long parameter names as
"keys" to set. Here is an example configuration file (<a href=
"selene.txt">N810</a>, <a href="rover.txt">N900</a>) that maps the
same keys the GUI does by default.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>All <a href=
"https://git.maemo.org/?p=drnoksnes;a=summary">development</a> is
done over Git.</p>
